- set is an object that save a unique data without a key
    let myBooks = new Set([1,2,3,3]);
    let myArray = [1,2,3,3];

    console.log(myBooks);
    console.log(myArray);

    console.log(myBooks); // cannot access with index
    console.log(myArray[1]);

- set Methods:
    let books = new Set('c++');
    books.add('c++');
    console.log(books);
    // {"c","+","c++"}
    books.delete('');
    books.clear();

- set VS WeakSet:
    set:
        - contain any types of values
        - get elements size on it
        - forEach available
        - if you set an object in it to null it still exist (garbage collection does not remove it )
   
    WeakSet:
        - contain object only    ( return invalid value if you try to add string or int)
        - you cannot use size    (return undefined)
        - forEach not available  (return forEach is not a function)
        - if you set an object in it to null it is deleted (garbage collection remove it )
