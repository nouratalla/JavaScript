- AJAX:
    - stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And xml
    - Approach to use many techs together [HTML, CSS, JS, DOM]
    - It use XMLHttpRequest object to interact with the server 
    - help you to fetch and send data without page refresh
    - example:
        - you fill a form and the user name is already exist in the db ajax without need to 
          press submit button make a call to the db and check if the user name is exist
    
    - Properties of XMLHttpRequest object:
        - readystate (status of XMLHttpRequest):
            - 0: request not initialized
            - 1: server connection established
            - 2: request received
            - 3: processing request
            - 4: request finished and response is ready
        - status ( returns the status-number of a request)
            - 200: "OK"
            - 404: "Not Found"
    

code Example:
// Create  XMLHttpRequest
const myReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
// open take Method, Url, async bool, user name and password
myReq.open("GET", "https://api.github.com/users/nouratalla");
myReq.send();
console.log(myReq);   
//is a property of the XMLHttpRequest Object which defines a function to be called when the readyState property changes
myReq.onreadystatechange = function () {
    if (this.readyState === 4 && this.status === 200)
        console.log(this.responseText);
}
